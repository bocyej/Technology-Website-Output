				Discord is a chat application that is similar to programs like Skype or TeamSpeak, or 
				professional communications platform like Slack.&nbsp; It's main target customers are video 
				game players, providing them easier ways to coordinate and talk to each other while playing 
				games.  The application also supports video calls, voice chat, and text.&nbsp; It is pretty 
				useful if you're trying to play PC games.&nbsp; Not only is Discord used when playing games 
				but it can also be used as an organizational and social tool.
			</p>
			<p>
				Users have also integrate Discord as a semipublic, forum-style community platform: Groups of 
				players with common interests, such as fans of a particular game or studio, can create or 
				join “servers,” both public and private, where lots of people can meet and hang out, chatting 
				via text, video, or voice.

			<h3>&nbsp; Why is Discord amazing?</h3>
			<p>
				Discord revolutionized the field of gaming communication in many ways.&nbsp; In the past, 
				people voice call each other through giving out Skype information, which is dangerous as 
				it can possible leak you IP address.&nbsp; Meanwhile, TeamSpeak is a pure voice communication 
				software that offers users voice call but its features are limited.&nbsp; Discord combines 
				the features of both Skype and TeamSpeak by allowing its users to chat and voice call.
				&nbsp; People can also use screen sharing for easier demonstration.&nbsp; It is also safe, 
				easy-to use, and does not slow down your games and device while using it, which makes it as 
				efficient as possible.&nbsp; And finally, Discord is free! It is available on PC, a web-based 
				version, and a mobile version.
