				Tablets are designed to be portable like laptops, but provide a different computing experience.&nbsp; Their difference between laptops is that tablets don't have physical keyboards or touchpads, but instead it's entire screen is touch sensitive, having a virtual keyboard and uses your finger as a mouse pointer.&nbsp; Another difference is that it runs apps designed specifically for tablets.&nbsp; Modern tablets come in different sizes, ranging from a slightly larger size of a smartphone to a size of a small laptop.&nbsp; Some tablets offer a keyboard and stylus accessory which some people may prefer than using virtual keyboard.&nbsp; The main purpose of a tablet is to become a convenience when using as a second computer, as it cannot necessarily do everything traditional computers can do.
